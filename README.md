Real estate Price Prediction is the process of estimating or forecasting the future prices of real estate properties,
such as houses, apartments, or commercial buildings. The goal is to provide accurate property rates to buyers, sellers,
investors, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions about real estate transactions. We collected, 
preprocessed dataset, did statistical analysis, developed model and finally created a basic Dash Web application for 
predicting real estate prices based on input features distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores 
nearby, latitude, and longitude.
